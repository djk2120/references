       {introduction}
       - how does gs respond to increasing D?
       {}
       - looking at gs = -m lnD + b
       - some interesting stuff on conditional sampling, autocorrelation
       {Estimating GSi and GS}
       - some interesting stuff on relating sap flux to gs
       {Theoretical analysis of stomatal sensitivity}
       - asking what stomatal behavior is required to regulate psi_l
       - interesting to think about stomatal sensitivity for my stuff

       {introduction}
       - it's the turgor, stupid
       - doesn't like that \sigma requires so many obs
       {methods}
       - expose various species to experimental drought
       - measure \psi predawn and midday
       - also PV curves
