       {introduction}
       - notes that gs and psi_s can be uncoupled
       - how do VPD and AL (as drivers) compare to psi_s?
       - when does sigma inform hydrological predictions?
       {modeling framework}
       - develops framework for assessing psi_l and g_s sensitivities
       {results}
       - "across sites, the influence of the VPD terms alone is sufficient to 
          completely decouple the relationship between the apparent sensitivities"

       {introduction}
       -"Precisely because isohydric and anisohydric species operate at different 
	water potentials, the fact that stomata are more sensitive to declining ΨL in 
	isohydric species does not imply that they will close earlier during drought. 
	The relevant question becomes whether the stomata of isohydric species are 
	more sensitive relative to the water potentials at which they operate, and 
	therefore constrain assimilation further in these species."
