       - definitions of isohydry vary
       - which is more drought resilient?
       - better to compare biological shiz
       - need to check out their examples (especially figure 4)
       - they hint at the importance of regimes (e.g. break at 0.5MPa)
       - they point out the soil conductance issue
       - like TLP, hydroscapes

       - looking at gs = -m lnD + b
       - some interesting stuff on conditional sampling, autocorrelation

       - asking what stomatal behavior is required to regulate psi_l
       - interesting to think about stomatal sensitivity for my stuff

       - it's the turgor, stupid
       - doesn't like that \sigma requires so many obs
       {methods}
       - expose various species to experimental drought
       - measure \psi predawn and midday
       - also PV curves
