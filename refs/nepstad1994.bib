abstract={Research has determined, using rainfall data, satellite imagery and field studies, that half of the closed forests of Brazilian Amazonia depend on deep root systems to maintain green canopies during the dry season. Forest alteration that affects depth distributions of carbon inputs from roots may also affect net carbon storage in the soil.},
